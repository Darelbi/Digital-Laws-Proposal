# AI Act (actual law proposal)

______

### Definitions
1. **Entity**: A person, organization, or business that possesses separate and 
distinct legal rights and responsibilities. This includes the ability to own 
property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and fulfill legal obligations.
For the purposes of this document, an entity also includes any individual or 
organization that owns an AI system.
2. **Artificial Intelligence(AI)**: AI or AI system, refers to any system that
utilizes artificial intelligence or machine learning methods, including but 
not limited to artificial neural networks. These systems are capable of 
performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing
patterns, making decisions, and learning from data.
3. **AI-Based Service**: Any service that relies on artificial intelligence or 
machine learning methods (AI) to be delivered. This includes services that utilize 
AI systems for tasks such as data analysis, decision-making, predictions, 
recommendations, or any other function that typically requires human intelligence.
4. **Digital AI Choice**: The mechanism by which an individual expresses their
preference regarding the usage of their data by AI systems on digital platforms,
including websites and any digital service (such as, but not limited to, 
desktop applications). 
4. **AI Choice**: The mechanism by which an individual expresses their
preference regarding the usage of their data by AI systems. For the purposes of
this document, any reference to "AI Choice" also includes "Digital AI Choice" 
without limiting the scope to digital platforms alone.
5. **Choice Context**: The framework within which an individual can express their
preferences regarding the usage of their data by AI systems.
6. **Timestamp**: Refers to the time (UTC, precise down to 1 second) some data
enters AI system. Any data derived from that has that timestamp.


# Rights section

______

### Explicit permission

1. An AI system shall not utilize any data or media unless explicit permission
has been granted by the original author or rights holder. This includes, but 
is not limited to, text, images, audio, video, recordings from security cameras,
personal data (including personal appearance and voice) obtained through digital
and non-digital means, and any other form of digital or non-digital content. 
The explicit permission must be documented and verifiable to ensure compliance 
with this regulation. Explicit permission must be granted with the format of a
Digital AI Choice, if this is not the case, it must be AI Choice performed by
legally signing a written contract.


### Non-Discrimination Based on AI Choice: 

2. Any AI Choice option shall not prevent access to any benefits, nor shall it
grant exclusive benefits. This includes, but is not limited to, access to 
premium content on websites or eligibility for casting in movies. Individuals
must not be denied access to services or opportunities based on their 
AI Choice. The AI Choice must not be used as leverage to coerce individuals 
into agreeing to AI usage. All contracts must remain valid and enforceable 
regardless of the individual’s decision to prohibit AI usage.

However, contracts specifically regarding the use of an individual’s appearance,
voice, or personality in AI systems are permissible, provided that neither the
existence nor the absence of such contracts restricts access to other 
opportunities or benefits beyond the agreed payment for the particular contract.


### Visibility of AI Choice: 

3. Whenever an AI choice is requested from an individual, the page/window 
(if it is a digital platform) or the contract section (if it is a written
contract) must prominently display a clearly visible 
"Artificial Intelligence Choice" label.

### Prohibition on Oral Contracts for AI Usage: 

4. Oral contracts cannot grant any AI usage rights on any data, content, 
or personal information. All permissions for AI usage must be documented 
in written form and comply with the modes established in this law.

### Format of Digital AI Choice:

5. Each time a Digital AI Choice is required for a particular Choice Context,
this choice must be presented through at least three options, which have to be well
and equally visible. These options must always be the first three options shown
and must remain prominently visible. The first option among these three must 
be default-selected. The options must be mutually exclusive and are defined as
follows:

   - No AI usage.
   - AI usage allowed by (ENTITY). 
   - AI usage allowed by anyone.
   
(ENTITY) is a placeholder for the entity name.
Any button in the section of AI choice must be either a "Cancel" button, that
takes the user out of the section. Or a "Confirm" button that register the
choice selected by the user. The choice of the user cannot be altered in any
way (in example, if user press "Confirm" no popup can be showed saying "we'd 
really like to use your data" with a "OK" button that once clicked change the
user choice to "No AI usage").
   
###  Global Digital AI Choice Requirement

6. A website that intends to use AI on users’ data or content must provide
at least one global Choice Context for the Digital AI Choice. This global 
Choice Context will apply to all the user’s data unless the user specifies
otherwise in other Choice Contexts. Any other permission granted not explicitly
through the modes established in this law shall be considered revoked and 
defaulted to "No AI usage." This includes, but is not limited to, websites that
have silently added an "AI option" and enabled it by default.

### Explicit Digital AI Choice Requirement: 

7. Digital AI Choice can only be provided through an explicit option as 
described in the Format of Digital AI Choice. This provision is to prevent 
other open licenses from being creatively interpreted as explicit permission
for AI usage. For example, this law does not allow MIT-licensed software or 
source code, or Creative Commons-licensed artworks to be processed by any 
AI system unless explicit permission is granted through the established modes.

### Industry Consensus for AI Usage Standards: 

8. Industries are free to reach a consensus on a standard that clearly
indicates when publicly available content can be used for AI purposes. 
Until such a standard is established, no assumptions can be made regarding
whether explicit permission has been granted for AI usage. Explicit 
permission must be documented and verifiable as per the modes established 
in this law.

### Prohibition on Third-Party AI Data Sharing:

9. Data that cannot be used on an individual’s or entity’s own AI system,
due to lack of explicit permission, shall not be shared, transferred, 
or fed to third-party AI systems. This ensures that data usage 
restrictions are upheld consistently across all AI systems and platforms.

### Data Transfer and Usage for AI Purposes

10. **Prohibition of Unauthorized Data Transfer**: No entity shall transfer data to
another entity for the purpose of AI usage unless the following conditions are
    - **Internal Standard Compliance**: Both entities must adhere to an internal standard
	that ensures the explicit consent of the data owner has been obtained. 
	It must include:
	  + Clear and comprehensible information on permissions given by user. 
	  + Record-keeping procedures to document the consent obtained. 
	  + Legal Compliance: The data transfer and subsequent usage must comply with all 
	  existing laws and regulations, including but not limited to data protection, 
	  privacy, and consumer rights laws.
	  
	- **Explicit Consent Requirement**: The explicit consent of the data owner 
	must be: 
	  + Informed: The data owner must be fully informed about the nature, 
	  purpose, and scope of the AI usage of their data. 
	  + Voluntary: The consent must be given freely without any form of 
	  coercion or undue influence.
	  + Documented: The consent must be documented in a manner that is 
	  verifiable and auditable.
	  + Explicit: The consent must be given explicitly through the Digital AI
	  Choice format. It cannot be given through an easily dismissible mean, 
	  in implicit ways: including but not limited to "Pop ups with just a OK 
	  button".
	  
11. **Restrictions on Data Usage**: Any data transferred for AI purposes shall
	remain subject to all existing legal restrictions and protections. This 
	includes, but is not limited to: 
	-Data Minimization: Only the minimum amount of data necessary for the 
	specified AI purpose shall be transferred and used. 
	-Purpose Limitation: The data shall only be used for the specific AI 
	purpose for which consent was obtained. 
	-Security Measures: Appropriate technical and organizational measures must
	be in place to protect the data from unauthorized access, disclosure, 
	alteration, or destruction.

### Mandatory AI Disclosure: 

12. All entities must identify if any service they offer or use internally 
involves AI systems. Clearly disclose this information to all users. The 
disclosure must be Clear and Accessible: Easily understandable and readily
available to users. The disclosure must be publicly available, and any change
to it (including the first disclosure made to obey this law) must always be
notified to all users. It must be publicly available on a dedicated page 
clearly labeled and entitled "Artificial Intelligence Services Information"
which must be easily accessible and always available.

13. Any content or data, produced or delivered by AI systems must be clearly
identified as AI-derived. If later discovered to be AI-derived, it must be 
either deleted or marked as AI-derived. This includes content with minimal
AI involvement (e.g., text correction, AI-guided color correction).

14. If AI is involved in delivery of a product, content, data or service it 
must be explained in detail which AI system or service was used, which data
was provided to it and how that data was used. In example, but not limited
to, it must be clearly stated if your religion or political opinion is being
used to limit visibility of your content to other people, or if content 
delivered to you is based on your religion or political opinion or if that
content is based on AI-derived data.

# Data handling section

______

### AI-Derived Data

15. From the moment any form of data, including but not limited to text, 
images, and videos, begins to enter an AI system, it shall be explicitly marked
with a timestamp. This timestamp shall be generated with the current UTC time  
with a precision of one second, starting from the entry of the first bit of
information. Additionally, any output produced by the AI system, including its
metadata (such as but not limited to neuron weights), shall be marked with the 
same timestamp and identified as AI-derived. This ensures that even if the data
takes several days or weeks to fully enter the system, the initial timestamp 
accurately reflects the start of the data entry process.
To clarify, if an AI model requires 30 days (2,592,000 seconds) for training,
the timestamp of any output must reflect the start of the data entry process.
This means the timestamp should be set to 2,592,000 seconds prior to the 
completion of the training, ensuring it accurately represents the moment the
first bit of data began entering the AI system.

16. The timestamp must be in "YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ" format.

17. AI-derived data shall not be used within an AI system if its timestamp is
earlier than 180 days compared to the current UTC time (15,552,000 seconds) at
any point during the processing. If the timestamp becomes older than 180 days
even one second before the AI system completes the processing, all resulting 
output must be discarded. This means that after you start training a model, you
have roughly 6 months to use it. Since its neural weights (in the case of an 
Artificial Neural Network) count as AI-derived data, after 6 months you can no 
longer use that data in an AI system, and without neural weights, an Artificial 
Neural Network is useless.

18. AI-derived data that is generated from other AI-derived data must retain 
the earliest timestamp among all data that entered the AI system. This 
requirement ensures that training AI models is always conducted only with 
explicitly permitted data. Additionally, any data for which permission is 
retracted will be purged in automatic from current models within six months.

19. The data must not be duplicated: If someone perform AI Choice, 
there should not be any duplicate of that data marked with older choices.
A choice performed by a user under a certain context should be applied
globally and worldwide istantly.

20. Any AI-derived data entering a data processing system, must retain the 
timestamp because it makes the data processing system (even if it is not a AI
system) to create at all effects AI-derived data.


### AI co-operation

21. An Entity cannot use AI-based services from another Entity that does not
operate under the same restrictions as this law, nor should it allow the usage
of its own services by that other Entity. For the purposes of this document, 
the exchange (receiving or sending or both) of AI-derived data is also 
considered an AI-based service.

For example, an entity from one country cannot use AI-based services from 
another country if that country does not adhere to the Artificial Intelligence 
Regulation Act (in a localized version). Additionally, if another country’s 
law allows the usage of AI-derived data in ways that are exceptional and 
contrary to the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act, services from that 
country cannot be used by entities in countries adhering to this law. For 
instance, if a country allows the storage of personal appearance for security 
facial recognition without user consent or without any time limit, it must be 
considered as “non-adhering to the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act.”

This provision still allows for differences in privacy laws and the usage of 
non-AI-based services, provided these are legal under other applicable laws.

This point is exceptionally restrictive because there is little control 
over what happens to data once it enters a AI system. That lack of control
could be in theory exploited to some degree.

### Relaxation on Timestamp

22. If an AI system, owned by the entity, does not process any data that requires
explicit permission, nor any data derived from such data, the owner may update
the timestamp of any AI-derived data generated by that system to the current 
UTC time at any moment

### Relaxation on Explicit permission for research

23. If a research was published providing an OPENLY AVAILABLE dataset for 
training AI models (like the MNIST dataset), if that data was collected with 
explicit permission of all participants to the research, even if that permission
is not in the format required by this law, then that data is allowed for use 
in AI. In that case, the timestamp is relaxed and can be always be updated to 
the current UTC time at any moment. This point requires the participants being
conscious to the fact they were contributing to AI models. So any contract
signed should be clear about that. Digital "Terms of Service" are not
considered valid since rarely someone read them carefully.

# Fines and Penalties
______

- **Minor Violations**: Fines up to €10 million or 2% of the entity’s global annual
turnover, whichever is higher.
- **Major Violations**: Fines up to €20 million or 4% of the entity’s global annual
turnover, whichever is higher.
- **Non-Compliance with Explicit Permission Requirements**: Fines up to €15 million
or 3% of the entity’s global annual turnover, whichever is higher.
- **Failure to Disclose AI Usage**: Fines up to €5 million or 1% of the entity’s 
global annual turnover, whichever is higher.

Points that constitute major violations if not respected are:  
2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,17,18,19,20,21

Apart Non-Compliance with Explicit Permission Requirements and Failure to 
Disclose AI Usage, all other remaining points, if not respected constitutes 
minor violations.

Not respecting one point, given how all these points are focused on a narrow concept,
almost certainly implies that more than one point is not respected. The penalties 
sum up for every point that the Entity fails to adhere to.

To the extent of this law, this law proposal can be considered AI-derived 
because Copilot was used to check for errors and proper legal terms in a
few points, some small points were suggested by the AI. The main
idea and text is all human.

The law is not Anti-AI. This law is for proper and ethical AI.



# User Rights
______

- **Right to Information**: Users have the right to be informed about the use
of their data by AI systems. This includes details on how their data is 
collected, processed, and used. This must include which AI-based services are
actually employed.


- **Right to Access**: Users can request access to their data that has been 
processed by AI systems and which kind of data was it generated from it.
Entities must provide this information in a clear and understandable format. 
This include data that has been received by third parties, even in the case
it was not memorized permanently before this law.


- **Right to Rectification**: Users have the right to request corrections to 
any inaccurate or incomplete data processed by AI systems. Especially if that
data was used to infer political or religious orientation.


- **Right to Erasure**: Users can request the deletion of their data from 
AI systems if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was 
collected or if they withdraw their consent. Due to the nature of AI systems
that put all collected data together in one complex and costly object from
which the extraction of original data is not easily viable, deletion
happens at most 6 months after the moment of the request.

# User Recourse:
______

- **Filing Complaints**: Users can file complaints with a designated regulatory
authority if they believe their rights have been violated under this law.


- **Seeking Redress**: Users can seek redress through legal channels if their 
data has been misused or if their rights have been infringed upon. This 
includes the right to compensation for any damages suffered.


- **Regulatory Authority**: A regulatory authority will be established to oversee
compliance with this law. This authority will handle user complaints, conduct 
investigations, and enforce penalties for non-compliance.

# Audit and Compliance:
______


- **Regular Audits**: Entities must undergo regular audits to ensure compliance
with this law. These audits will be conducted by independent third-party 
auditors approved by the regulatory authority.


- **Audit Reports**: Entities must submit audit reports to the regulatory authority
on a yearly basis. These reports should detail the entity’s compliance with 
the law, including data handling practices, security measures, and user consent
procedures.


- **Compliance Officers**: Entities must appoint a compliance officer responsible 
for overseeing adherence to this law. The compliance officer will act as a 
point of contact for the regulatory authority and users.


- **Record-Keeping**: Entities must maintain detailed records of all data 
processing activities, including user consents, data transfers, and AI system 
operations. These records must be made available to the regulatory authority 
upon request.

- **Transparency Reports**: Entities must publish transparency reports detailing
their AI data processing activities, including the types of data processed, 
the purposes of processing, and the measures taken to ensure compliance with 
this law.
