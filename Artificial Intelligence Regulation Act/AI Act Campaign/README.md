# Oppose Big Tech’s Free Run to Protect Millions of Jobs, Personal Privacy, and Intellectual Property Rights

AI impacts everyone, from individuals to businesses. People are concerned 
about privacy, job security, and the ethical use of their data. For instance, 
AI systems can process personal data without explicit consent, leading to 
potential misuse and discrimination. Here is a list of jobs currently at 
risk (not exhaustive):

 - **Clerical and Secretarial Roles**: Even priests are being replaced by AI.
 - **Teachers**: Great Britain has started experimenting with teacher-less classrooms.
 - **Customer Service**: Most companies rely, at least partially, on chatbots.
 - **Retail**: Online selling is increasing, while shops are closing.
 - **Manufacturing**: The industry is heavily investing in AI-controlled processes.
 - **Transportation**: Driver-less cars are a reality in some countries.
 - **Banking**: Online banking combined with chatbots is becoming a reality.
 - **Insurance**: AI collects your data from other companies to profile you.
 - **Finance**: AI usage to make profitable decisions is widespread, but the consequences 
of these actions are not properly evaluated or regulated.
 - **Media and Advertising**: AI-generated videos are widespread for advertising now.
 - **Writers**: Online shops are literally polluted with AI-generated books.
 - **Publishers**: Publishers that rely on human work only are facing high 
competitiveness from AI publishers.
 - **Journalists**: There are several notorious cases of press agencies 
reducing staff in favor of AI over real humans.
 - **Programmers**: Many tasks can already be replaced by AI, and 30% of software
developers believe they could be replaced by AI in the near future.
 - **Legal Services and Lawyers**: Many companies rely on generating terms and 
conditions with AI.
 - **Healthcare**: While a surgeon cannot yet be replaced, there are attempts 
at replacing other healthcare roles.
 - **Artists**: The vast majority of artists can no longer afford to live on art 
because of the ability of AI to generate images.
 - **Psychotherapists**: There have been several attempts to replace mental health
professionals with AI, some successful to some degree. A therapy should also
aim to reduce social isolation: an AI therapist represents even more isolation.
 
If you look at research on these topics, most people define each task as a
“challenge.” So that’s all. The industry sees replacing humans as a challenge.
While there are still things that AI can’t replace, its continuous improvement 
puts even more jobs at risk.

If AI remains unregulated, the risks include widespread job loss, privacy 
violations, and unethical use of data. Without clear guidelines, AI could 
perpetuate biases, leading to unfair treatment in areas like hiring and lending. 
Conversely, proper regulation can ensure AI is used ethically, protecting jobs 
and personal data, and fostering trust in AI technologies. This, of course, 
includes things that are actually considered crimes (e.g., revenge porn deep 
fakes).

Immediate action is crucial as AI technology rapidly evolves. Establishing 
regulations now can prevent potential harms and ensure AI development aligns 
with societal values. By acting promptly, we can safeguard privacy, promote 
fairness, and create a balanced environment where AI benefits everyone without 
compromising ethical standards.

Moreover, if big tech companies truly care about ethics and empathy, they 
will support this law. A law would not only ensure ethical AI use but also 
limit their competitors, creating a fairer market.

So, I need you to vote on this campaign for this law proposal:

AI Act Proposal

And help me spread the word among all the people. Because maybe your job
cannot (yet) be replaced by AI, but one day it might be.

This law should be the bare minimum to help fight the unethical use of AI. 
Of course, it’s open to debate and improvements (you can subscribe to the 
site and create “issues,” for example)
